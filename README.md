🔍 Step 1 — Sales Performance Analysis (SQL)

SQL queries analyze:

Revenue by sales rep

Revenue by region

Revenue by product

Month-over-month growth

This creates a single source of truth for sales performance.

🤖 Step 2 — Revenue Forecasting (Python)

A time-series forecasting model predicts:

Next quarter revenue

Product-level growth

Region-wise performance

Leadership can now ask:

“Will we hit our quarterly target — and if not, where do we fix it?”

📈 Step 3 — Territory & Quota Planning (Excel)

Excel models calculate:

Rep quotas

Target vs actual

Over-performance and risk zones

This allows sales managers to rebalance territories and targets.

📊 Step 4 — Power BI Executive Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard shows:

Total revenue

Target vs actual

Rep performance leaderboard

Region & product trends

Next quarter forecast

This turns raw sales data into real-time leadership decisions.
